2. What command would you use to perform a detailed scan on a target IP `192.168.1.1` to determine the operating system?
3. How can you scan a range of IP addresses from `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.10`?
4. What command can you use to perform a scan that detects both open ports and service versions on a target `example.com`?
5. How do you perform a scan to check for active hosts in a subnet `192.168.1.0/24`?
6. What command would you use to perform a scan and show the network services running on open ports of a target `192.168.1.1`?
7. How can you perform a quick scan to identify which hosts are up in the `192.168.1.0/24` network?
8. What command is used to perform a stealth SYN scan on a target host `example.com`?
9. How do you run an `nmap` scan with a custom port range, for example, ports 80 to 100 on `192.168.1.1`?
10. What command can you use to perform a script scan using `nmap` on a target host `example.com`?Certainly! Here are the 10 questions related to creating and manipulating data files in Linux:
11. **How do you perform an `nmap` scan to discover all hosts on a specific network segment without scanning ports?**
12. **What command can you use to perform a scan and include service version detection and operating system fingerprinting on `192.168.1.1`?**
13. **How can you run an `nmap` scan to find out if a specific port, such as port 22, is open on a target host `example.com`?**
14. **What command would you use to perform an `nmap` scan and output the results in XML format?**
15. **How do you execute an `nmap` scan that will show you the hostnames associated with the IP addresses in the target range?**
16. **What command is used to perform a TCP connect scan on a target `192.168.1.1`?**
17. **How can you perform a scan that includes `nmap`'s aggressive scan option, which combines multiple scan types and script scanning?**
18. **What command would you use to scan for open ports on a specific range of IP addresses and also include a timing template to speed up the scan?**
19. **How do you run an `nmap` scan with a specific timing template to reduce the likelihood of being detected by intrusion detection systems?**
20. What command can you use to run a `nmap` scan with a custom script specified by the user to check for vulnerabilities on `example.com`?
